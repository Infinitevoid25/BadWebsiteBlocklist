# Contributing

To help out with the blocklist, you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/popcar2/BadWebsiteBlocklist/issues) explaining why a website should be blocked or unblocked. Feel free to also submit a PR alongside the issue to close it!

This contributors guide will help you figure out which websites are welcome on the list.

# Topics that are out of scope

These websites aren't covered by the blocklist, so please don't submit block requests for them. *I just don't want to deal with it.*

1. **Anything politics**
2. **Anything NSFW or disgusting**

## What makes a bad website

BadWebsiteBlocklist tries to block websites that nobody wants to see in search results. If possible, block subdomains rather than entire websites if that solves the problem (such as misleading corporate blogs).
The general rule is to block as little as possible to maintain quality in search results.

Currently, the list has three categories of bad websites:

### **1. AI Generated or low-effort spam**

Websites that are used created to make a quick buck by abusing AI and SEO to push their website while contributing nothing of value.

Look out for websites that have blatantly wrong info, churn out a suspicious amount of articles per day, create nothing but low effort content, etc.

### **2. Misleading Advertisements**

Websites that are absolutely biased or untrustworthy, constantly pushing their own products or affiliates while trying to sound like honest recommendations or reviews.

Example: "How to partition your hard drive" article that tells you to use a paid program that's currently 70% off or something.

Example 2: "Top 5 free VPNs" article where the #1 spot is - unsurprisingly - their own VPN.

### 3. Viruses & fake versions of real websites

Websites that straight up hosts viruses/adware and tries to trick people into downloading them. A popular example would be Softonic, which bundles free downloads with bloat and potentially unwanted programs.

## What DOESN'T make a bad website

This blocklist tries to block websites that are *definitely* low quality or misleading. There are plenty of websites that are on the edge, but are still not worth blocking. These include:

* Websites that use clickbait but still produce decent quality articles
* Corporate blogs that brag about their accomplishments but aren't misleading
* Websites that make dumb content but you'd have to go out of your way to find them (ex: BuzzFeed)

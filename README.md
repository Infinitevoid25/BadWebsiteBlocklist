# Bad Website Blocklist

This is a blocklist that intends to remove garbage websites from search results, such as AI-generated articles, low-effort spam sites, and thinly-veiled advertisements acting as information.

  <b>Comparison with the blocklist vs without</b> 
  
  (AI & SEO spam are removed to make room for good articles)

</div>

Another big goal of this repo is to try to be as organized as possible, [every website that gets blocked has an issue](https://github.com/popcar2/BadWebsiteBlocklist/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) explaining why it was added to the list for future reference.

## How to use

1. Install the [uBlacklist extension](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/docs)
2. Click on the extension in the browser toolbar, then click on "Options"
3. Click on "Enable" next to other search engines, then enable it for the search engines you use
4. Scroll down to subscriptions and click "Add a subscription"
5. Give it a name & add this as the URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/popcar2/BadWebsiteBlocklist/refs/heads/main/uBlacklist.txt

And that's it. The websites in the list should no longer appear on when searching! The subscription means the blocklist will always stay up to date as well.

## Contributing

This was inspired by the great effort of [the huge AI blocklist](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist) and my boiling hatred to bad tech support articles.

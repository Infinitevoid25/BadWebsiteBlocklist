# Bad Website Blocklist

This is a blocklist that intends to remove garbage websites from search results, such as AI-generated articles and low-effort spam sites. Relies on the [uBlacklist browser extension](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/docs).

The biggest goal of this repo is to try to be as organized as possible, every website that gets blocked has an issue related to it explaining why it was added to the list for future reference.

## How to use

1. Install the [uBlacklist extension](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/docs)
2. Click on the extension in the browser toolbar, then click on "Options"
3. Click on "Enable" next to other search engines, then enable it for the search engines you use
4. Scroll down to subscriptions and click "Add a subscription"
5. Give it a name & add this as the URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/popcar2/BadWebsiteBlocklist/refs/heads/main/uBlacklist.txt

And that's it. The websites in the list should no longer appear on when searching!

## Contributing

If you'd like to add a website to the list, [create an issue](https://github.com/popcar2/BadWebsiteBlocklist/issues/new/choose) then wait for me to check its validity and add it to the list (or create a pull request to close that issue then wait for me to review it).

This was inspired by the great effort of [the huge AI blocklist](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist), but is not exclusive or focused at banning AI websites specifically.
